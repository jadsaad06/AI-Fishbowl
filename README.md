# AI-Fishbowl
AI Fishbowl is an interactive installation that brings conversational AI to life through a talking digital fish. The system uses speech recognition (STT), natural language generation, and text-to-speech (TTS) to let users hold fluid, voice-based conversations with a virtual fish inside an on-screen aquarium to fulfill their PSU CS needs.
